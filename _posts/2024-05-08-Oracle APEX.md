## Introduction


The entire industry is having extensive discussions about the future of coding. Many people believe that in the future, coding may no longer be essential ([Nvidia’s CEO On The Democratization Of Coding - Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timbajarin/2024/03/20/nvidias-ceo-on-the-democratization-of-coding/?sh=7bb77ad7a95a)). Although I do not fully agree with this perspective (at least for now), I genuinely believe that low-code applications have several benefits, especially for medium or small applications. I really believe they will gain much more prominence in the future.

Indeed, we developers need to recognize the value of low-code applications today and acknowledge that there are several advantages over coded platforms:

1. **Low Cost**
2. **Speed**
3. **Productivity**
4. **Accessibility**
5. **Consistency/Quality**
6. **Focus on Business**

That’s where APEX comes into the scene!

### Apex

As described in [Oracle Site](https://apex.oracle.com/pt-br/), Oracle APEX is a **low-code** enterprise application platform that enables you to create scalable, secure web and mobile applications that can be deployed anywhere.

Nowadays Apex is used for:

- Develop Responsive Web Apps
- Visualize and manage data
- Apply SQL and database capabilities

Talking a little about it's caracteristics. It's important to know that Apex does not require any client software, the App development IDE is a web browser, there is no code generation, all the app definitions are stored in databases as metadata, and all the data is processed in the database.

Oracle Apex Infraesctruture is a fully supported no-cost feature of Oracle Autonomous Database and all Oracle Database Distribuitions and Editions, either on premises, either on cloud. On autonomous Database, Oracle Apex provides a pre-configured, fully managed and secured environmnent to both develop and deploy applications. And it's architecture is composed as described in the image bellow:

One point that is very good to know is that there is no complex pricing associated with the number of developers that are using Apex or the number of applications and it can be deployed wherever Oracle Database runs, be it on the cloud, dedicated region, third party, or on premises.

## Project 

After clarifying all the summary aspects of Apex, we can proceed to create some real applications there and see its true value. For this project the objetive is to understand
