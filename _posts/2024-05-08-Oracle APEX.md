## Introduction


The entire industry is having extensive discussions about the future of coding. Many people believe that in the future, coding may no longer be necessary TechRadar. Although I do not fully agree with this perspective, I genuinely think low-code applications have several benefits.

Indeed, we developers need to recognize the value of low-code applications today and acknowledge that there are several advantages over coded platforms:

1. **Low Cost**
2. **Speed**
3. **Productivity**
4. **Accessibility**
5. **Consistency/Quality**
6. **Focus on Business**

Thatâ€™s where APEX comes into the scene! As described in [Oracle Site](https://apex.oracle.com/pt-br/), Oracle APEX is a low-code enterprise application platform that enables you to create scalable, secure web and mobile applications that can be deployed anywhere, in the cloud or on premises.

Apex is used for:

- Develop Responsive Web Apps
- Visualize and manage data
- Apply SQL and database capabilities

APEX also has some distinguishing characteristics. It does not require any client software, the App development IDE is a web browser, there is no code generation, all the app definitions are stored in databases as metadata, and all the data is processed in the database.
