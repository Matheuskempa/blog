## Introduction

Welcome back! This project is a bit outside the realm of Data Engineering, but it’s always good to explore other areas. They strengthen you as a professional, and in the end, you’ll have more tools to tackle your challenges. This particular problem was proposed by the business area in two of my previous jobs, and my approach was similar to what’s described in this post.

I firmly believe that the best way to learn is by doing. So focus on the concepts behind this post—understanding why and how each tool is used is crucial. Let me recap the project steps so that you can replicate and start projects from scratch, without simply copying and pasting. Smartly navigating through the process will ensure you emerge on the other side without major concerns
