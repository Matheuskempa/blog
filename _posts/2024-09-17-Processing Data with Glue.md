## Introduction

In this post we will talk about a very good tool inside of of AWS ecosystem. Launched in August 2017, AWS Glue began as an ETL service to simplify loading databases, data warehouses, and building data lakes on Amazon S3. It has since expanded to include a broader set of data integration features for ETL specialists and data scientists. Today, AWS Glue serves hundreds of thousands of customers monthly M. Saxena et al (2023). 

I always emphasize that my main focus is delivering good projects. Nevertheless, that's why we are going to create a project with it.
