# About page

My carrier started as intern in Oi and later Caixa Seguradora. By the time i was doing my Administration & Business Degree and i was learning about machine learning (ML) in my University subject. I really saw as an advantage for me to go study ML so that i could be different from other people.

Because of my work as a Intern Data "Analyst" in Caixa Seguradora, i already had some of skills to treat data, otherwise in that time i did not have full knlowege about all kinds of treatments that i should do, i was alreay able to build Dashboards on Excel and on power BI. So i started to understand the other side of treating data for ML, and i think i did a great job. I was able to publish my article [Machine learning algorithms for fraud prediction in property insurance: Empirical evidence using real-world microdata](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666827021000372>) with the help of my leader professor.

After that my period of intern finished at Caixa Seguradora, but i decided to not stay there, i tryed to create a startup in that time, but it did not go well. So i joined Brasal Refrigerantes and my REarche Group at Univeristy of Brasilia (UnB), in order to persue my focus on working with data. My time at BRasal was short because i was suprised on not working with what i really want there, thats why i left the company and kept studying Machine Learning and Data Archictetures at my REaarch GROup at University of Brasilia (UnB). 

After that i worked in a insitute, called I3GS, where i was doing some study predictions and automating some tasks in Python. 

BUt the changing point was where i went to VLGI investimentos,there was where i really started my carrir of DAta Engineering. My stack leader gave me the opportunity to learn and implement AIRFLOW there, and now i had to opportunity to see full extension of Python it self, because as a Data Scientist i did not care to code with the best practises. IN VLGI i was able to do a lot of ETL jobs orchestrated by AIRFLOW, dbt on doing data transformations, integration with several APIs (CRM, MailChimp, GOogle Ads, FAcebook Ads) using Python and also learned a lot of Postgre.

After my time in VLGI, i receveid an offer to go to BRBCARD, the best oppotunity i had so far, there...

I was then promoted to Senior Data Engeneering and now i want to share a lit bit of what i know here, i hope i don't write wrong things here, but if i do feel free to tell me, as my objectiv here is one, always keep learning! Thank you!
